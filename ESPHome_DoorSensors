Warning: YMMV if running HA on an RPI 3B+ or less. I had one, and it didn't have enough computing power to run ESPHome.


HARDWARE NEEDS:
 - Wemos D1 Mini / $14.98 for 5 (https://www.amazon.com/Organizer-ESP8266-Internet-Development-Compatible/dp/B081PX9YFV/ref=sr_1_3)
    - Power Source, too (Micro USB-powered)
 - Magnetic Reed Switch / $10.59 for 10 (https://www.amazon.com/BNYZWOT-Surface-Contact-Sensor-Magnetic/dp/B07VSVZYHW/)
 - Soldering Iron & Solder
 - Wire (I have cut into unused ethernet cable and used that--the pairs being twisted together work great)
 - A *GOOD* Micro USB Cable--one that will do data transfer, not just charging)
 
SOFTWARE INSTRUCTIONS
   1. Get ESPHome installed and running in HA
   2. With the Micro USB data cable, plug the Wemos D1 Mini into your PC (mine is a Windows machine. can't speak for Mac or Linux) and hit the "New Device" button. Follow on-screen instructions.
   3. Device will [should] appear in ESPHome. Click Edit.
   4. A line or two under "captive_portal:", you can fill in your details for your specific need (in this case: the reed sensor for door/window)
    here's what my config looked like below "captive_portal:" (the hashtags are to separate out the code):
#######################
binary_sensor:
  - platform: gpio
    name: D2
    device_class: door
    pin:
      number: GPIO4
      mode: INPUT_PULLUP
#######################
      - The "D2" name is just which pin I decided to use. You can honestly name it anything, but that's how it will come into HA. And once it's in HA, you can also changes its name or entity_id.
      - Device class doesn't really matter because it's a binary_sensor, it's ultimately on or off, but the UI does distinguish it as an open or closed door.
      - the pin number is the obnoxious one. https://i0.wp.com/randomnerdtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ESP8266-WeMos-D1-Mini-pinout-gpio-pin.png. <<< this will tell you the GPIO code for the respective pin you're using. You can only use pins D1 through D8. '
      - honestly, not quite sure on the "mode", so I just run with it since it has never lead me wrong with "INPUT_PULLUP"
   5. Finish up, and HA should discover the new ESPHome device pretty quickly, and there you'll see however you labeled your pins. I don't remember for the first time if I had to add the ESPHome integration or if it was auto-discovered. But additional devices later on have always quickly auto-discovered.

HARDWARE INSTRUCTIONS:
You can theoretically put upto 8 reed switches on one Wemos D1 Mini and monitor 8 doors/windows/whatevers. The reed switch needs to connect the desired pin (D1 through D8) to the G (Ground). If you have multiple sensors, you'll have multiple wires going into the ground--this is where some handywork will need to come in.
   1. Prepare a desired length of wire to connect the Wemos D1 Mini to the reed switch (make sure the Wemos is near an outliet and in a safe place--no it isn't electrically unsafe, but it can easily short itself out. A dab of hot glue and piece of cardboard is handy in a pinch)
   2. MAKE SURE the wired side of the reed switch is on the door frame (because I did this in reverse my first time not thinking), and the stand-alone magnet is on the moving piece. Some of these come with double-sided adhesive foam--which has worked well for me.

aaannd, that should do it! 

Bonus project: build a sensor to detect if your dumb deadbolt is locked:
 - Momentary Push Button (https://www.amazon.com/TWTADE-Yellow-Orange-6x6x5mm-Tactile/dp/B07C7211PJ)
 - A little spring--like the size that would hold in an AA battery
 - Lots of patience
Connect the spring to the button, and get that inside the door jamb deadbold bore hole (I had to drill mine a bit deeper to accomodate). Find a way to get the wires from the button out and to your Wemos, and solder one to an open D-Pin and the other to Ground. 

Here's my full config for one of my doors. It has two reed sensors (glass door, screen door) and one lock as described above: https://github.com/smibrandon/HA/blob/main/wemos-esphome-bk_door

Good luck!
